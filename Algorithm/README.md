- Note that the command names provided by \verb|algpseudocode| are typically title-cased, e.g.~\verb|\State|, \verb|\While|, \verb|\EndWhile|.

>Algcompatible[click here](https://github.com/brcnitk/GEC-Chamarajanagar/blob/main/Algorithm/Algcompatible.tex)
- Note that the command names provided by \verb|algorithmic| are all uppercased, e.g.~\verb|\STATE|, \verb|\WHILE|, \verb|\ENDWHILE|. On the other hand, \verb|algcompatible| will recognise uppercased and title-cased command names, so \verb|\STATE|, \verb|\WHILE|, \verb|\ENDWHILE|, \verb|\State|, \verb|\While|, \verb|\EndWhile| are all recognised.

>Algorithm2e[click here](https://github.com/brcnitk/GEC-Chamarajanagar/blob/main/Algorithm/Algorithm2e.tex)
- The algorithm2e package has quite different syntax structure from the algpseudocode, algcompatible and algorithmic packages, so you will need to be careful about which package you want to use, or which package your template has loaded.
